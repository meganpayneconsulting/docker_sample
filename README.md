# Using Flask with Docker: a classification example

This repo is a sample workflow to taking a machine learning model and copying it inside a docker container to query off of. The provided model is a penguin classification model using logistic regression, however any model using tabular data with a prediction step can be substituted here. The running instructions are a quick start guide and more detail is included below.

## Running instructions (Quick Start)

This builds a docker container and allows the user to query the penguin classification machine learning model using curl or a GUI like Postman.

To run: (see the explanation of steps below for details)

1. install docker on the host computer
2. build and run the sample docker container
    * docker login
    * docker pull python
    * docker build -t testimage -f Dockerfile_minimal .
    * docker run testimage
3. build and save the model locally
    * install any missing libraries necessary. See requirements.txt for a list.
    * python classification_example.py
4. build and run the docker container with the classification model
    * docker build -t penguin_model -f Dockerfile .
    * docker run -i -p 8080:5000 penguin_model
5. Use curl to query using sample data in a dictionary with key X_new
    * curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"X_new":"46.2,14.5,209.0,48800"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict

## Explanation of each step

### Installing Docker on the host computer

Docker has [complete instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on how to install the docker software. 
This is how the docker container will be built.

### Build and run the sample docker container

The first step is to pull the base image from the [Docker container image library](https://hub.docker.com/). 
You will need to create a free account, as you need to supply the username and password. The command "docker login" will 
ask for the username and password. The base image used in this repository is "python". 

The next step is to build the sample docker container to make sure that you have everything configured correctly. 
This should print out to the console a success message. The docker container you are building is named "testimage".

A common error is to forget the . in the command building the container. This . is not a typo! 

Run the docker container. The run command has many switches but they aren't necessary here. 

### Build and save the model locally

This is designed to build the model and save it using joblib. Simply run the python file.

### Build and run the docker container with the classification model

This is similar to the previous step, building the sample container. Notice it uses a different Dockerfile because the blueprints to 
construct the image and container are different.

The docker run command uses a few switches. The -i runs in interactive mode and the -p maps port 8080 on the host to 5000 in the container.

### Use curl to query using the sample data

This is the test for success. You should run this command and receive a predicted penguin species. 

The switches used in the curl command are:

    * v verbose
    * H headers. This is where you specify json, the format used to transfer the data.
    * d data. This is where you send out of sample, unseen data to the model, to use in the prediction. 


## That is it!
